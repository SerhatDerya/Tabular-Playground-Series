# Tabular-Playground-Series
This repository contains solutions of monthly Tabular Playground Series in Kaggle.
## MARCH 22
For the March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series you're 
challenged to forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a U.S. 
metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labelled with both 
location coordinates and a direction of travel -- a combination of 
features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network.
